# embedded-server
A tiny, minimalistic and cross-platform web server written entirely in .NET Standard with a simple ASP.NET-**like** API.

The idea is to have a simple, minimal and lightweight web server that is easy to use and is largely exchangeable with code written using ASP.NET Core.

The advantage of EmbeddedServer is that it is dependency-free, a single assembly (you can even include the project in any of your solutions and have it work hassle-free.

Features:
1. Cross Platform - Written entirely in .NET Standard 2.0
2. Its minimal. Powerful but with simple features.
2. ASP.NET like syntax and patterns. It's clean, extensible and familiar.
3. It's fast.

EmbeddedServer best fits in the following scenarios:
1. You want a single `dll` library with no external dependencies.
2. You want to host a web server inside
